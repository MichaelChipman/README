# Michael Chipman | Aspiring AI Engineer

### AAS Degree Candidate at Maestro College

I am a foundational learner committed to developing robust **AI engineering and automation skills**. Currently, I am building my core software development expertise, starting with **Python (Py 101)**.

This repository serves as my living portfolio, documenting my journey, showcasing class assignments, and tracking personal coding experiments as I progress through the program.

## 🌟 My Drive & Interests

My focus is on using technology to **automate tasks and solve real-world problems** efficiently. I believe in exploring AI's power and building tools that help teams move forward safely.

This drive for **methodical creation** extends to my hobbies, which include **woodworking** and video games focused on automation, balanced by the **creativity** of baking and cooking.

## 🚀 Learning Modules & Projects

### 1. Foundational Python Scripts (Py 101)

These are hands-on assignments focusing on essential programming concepts to build a strong engineering base.

| File | Status | Description | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| [`py_101/scoreboard.py`](py_101/scoreboard.py) | Complete (Lesson 1) | Demonstrates core Python syntax, variable management, user input/output handling, and effective in-line commenting. | 
| [`py_101/badge_generator.py`](py_101/badge_generator.py) | Complete (Lesson 2) | Focuses on **Error Handling (TypeError/NameError)**, **Type Checking**, variable type conversion (`int()`), and advanced string creation for output. |
| [`py_101/badge_expressions.py`](py_101/badge_expressions.py) | Complete (Lesson 3) | Focuses on **Arithmetic Expressions**, **Operator Precedence**, `f-string` formatting with math (`:.2f`), and type handling (int, float) for accurate calculations. ([Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/maestro/comments/1oo1a3s/title_py_101_lesson_3_price_board_project/)) |
| [`py_101/badge_update_print.py`](py_101/badge_update_print.py) | Complete (Lesson 4) | Focuses on **Compound Assignment** (`+=`, `-=`), variable reassignment, **comma-separated `print()`**, and the use of the **`round()`** function to correct **floating-point imprecision** due to the base-2 system. |
| [`py_101/balance_board.py`](py_101/balance_board.py) | Complete (L4 Stretch) | A dedicated stretch challenge project demonstrating **tuple creation** via comma assignment, the resulting `len()` constraint, and the required **string concatenation workaround** for calculating dynamic border sizes. |
| [`py_101/modeling_real_world_calculations.py`](py_101/modeling_real_world_calculations.py) | Complete (Lesson 5) | Focuses on translating word problems, comparing expression clarity, and a deep dive into **Type Errors** and **String/Tuple data type constraints** when using concatenation (`+`) versus explicit `str()` casting. |
| [`py_101/division_ops.py`](py_101/division_ops.py) | Complete (Lesson 6) | Focuses on the three division operators: **True Division (`/`)**, **Floor Division (`//`)**, and the **Modulo Operator (`%`)** for finding quotients and remainders in practical, real-world applications (e.g., time and boxes). |
| [`py_101/modulo_practice.py`](py_101/modulo_practice.py) | Complete (Lesson 7) | Focuses on advanced applications of the **Modulo Operator (`%`)** for determining **parity** (even/odd), calculating **cycle repetition**, and finding a specific **position** within a repeating sequence (e.g., scheduling). |
| [`py_101/rounding_and_money.py`](py_101/rounding_and_money.py) | Complete (Lesson 8) | Demonstrates **currency formatting** by distinguishing between **value rounding** (`round()`) and **output formatting** (`:.2f`), explicitly addressing floating-point imprecision and reusing the Modulo Operator for scheduling. |
| [`py_101/user_input_demo.py`](py_101/user_input_demo.py) | Complete (Lesson 9) | Focuses on **user input (`input()`)** and **explicit type casting** (`int()`, `float()`), demonstrating how to handle raw string input and convert it into numerical data required for calculations like averaging test scores. |
