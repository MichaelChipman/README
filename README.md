# Michael Chipman | Aspiring AI Engineer

### AAS Degree Candidate at Maestro College

I am a foundational learner committed to developing robust **AI engineering and automation skills**. Currently, I am building my core software development expertise, starting with **Python (Py 101)**.

This repository serves as my living portfolio, documenting my journey, showcasing class assignments, and tracking personal coding experiments as I progress through the program.

## 🌟 My Drive & Interests

My focus is on using technology to **automate tasks and solve real-world problems** efficiently. I believe in exploring AI's power and building tools that help teams move forward safely.

This drive for **methodical creation** extends to my hobbies, which include **woodworking** and video games focused on automation, balanced by the **creativity** of baking and cooking.

## 🚀 Learning Modules & Projects

### 1. Foundational Python Scripts (Py 101)

These are hands-on assignments focusing on essential programming concepts to build a strong engineering base.

| File | Status | Description | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| `scoreboard.py` | Complete (Lesson 1) | Demonstrates core Python syntax, variable management, user input/output handling, and effective in-line commenting. | 

### 2. Homework Assignments

*To be populated with larger, multi-concept solutions.*

### 3. Small Automation Tools

*Future projects focusing on efficiency and real-world problem-solving.*

### 4. Fun Experiments

*Future projects focused on creativity, visualization, and new libraries.*

## 🌎 Vision

My ultimate goal is to leverage AI to help humanity build a better future.
