# Michael Chipman

Aspiring AI engineer currently pursuing my AAS degree at Maestro College.  
Learning Python and building a foundation in software engineering and automation.  
This repository will showcase my projects, class assignments, and experiments as I progress through the program.

## Projects

- Python practice scripts  
  These are hands-on exercises from my coursework at Maestro College. Each script focuses on building foundational Python skills, such as working with variables, getting user input, writing comments, and understanding basic program flow.
  - **scoreboard.py** — Practice from Lesson 1: basic Python syntax, variables, input/output, and writing comments in code
- Homework assignments
- Small automation tools
- Fun experiments

More coming soon!
